        <h2>1. About Our App</h2>
        <p><strong>Photo To Puzzle</strong>, developed by <strong>Caffeinated Dev</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"), is an offline game app that lets you create and play puzzles from photos. We use the Unity Ads SDK to serve advertisements. The app itself does not collect or store personal data, but Unity Ads collects certain data to provide ads, as described below. By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. We will update this policy if we add features that involve new data collection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section2">
        <h2>2. Data Collected by Unity Ads</h2>
        <p>The Unity Ads SDK collects the following data to serve ads and analyze ad performance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising Identifier</strong>: A unique, resettable ID (e.g., Android Ad ID or iOS IDFA) for personalized ads and analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate Location</strong>: Derived from your IP address for ad targeting (not precise GPS location).</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase History</strong>: Information about in-app purchases or ad interactions for targeting and analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>App Activity</strong>: Data like page views, taps, and usage times during ad interactions (not gameplay) for ad performance and fraud prevention.</li>
            <li><strong>App Diagnostics</strong>: Technical data like crash reports to ensure app functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unity Ads does <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email, financial details, health data, messages, photos, videos, or precise location. All data is encrypted during transmission. For more details, see <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>Our app does not collect additional data. If we add features requiring data collection, we will update this policy and notify you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section3">
        <h2>3. How Data Is Used and Shared</h2>
        <p>Unity Ads uses the collected data to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver personalized ads tailored to your interests.</li>
            <li>Analyze ad performance and user engagement.</li>
            <li>Ensure app functionality, security, and fraud prevention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data may be shared with Unity Ads’ partners, such as ad networks and analytics providers, to support these services. This sharing may be considered a “sale” of data under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Data may also be shared with service providers (e.g., hosting providers) or as required by law. Unity Ads operates globally, so data may be transferred internationally, subject to their privacy protections. See <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity’s Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section4">
        <h2>4. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>You have control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt Out of Personalized Ads</strong>: Use your device settings to limit ad tracking:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>iOS</strong>: Enable “Limit Ad Tracking” in Settings > Privacy > Advertising.</li>
                    <li><strong>Android</strong>: Enable “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in Settings > Google > Ads.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>: Request deletion of data collected by Unity Ads via their <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Portal</a> or contact us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>GDPR Rights (EEA Users)</strong>: If you’re in the European Economic Area, you can access, correct, delete, restrict, or port your data, object to processing, or withdraw consent for ads. Unity Ads may prompt you for consent when you first view an ad. Contact Unity Ads or us at <a href="mailto:hello.caffeinateddev@gmail.com">hello.caffeinateddev@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>CCPA Rights (California Residents)</strong>: You can request to know, delete, or opt out of the “sale” of your data (via device settings or Unity Ads). We do not discriminate against users exercising these rights. Contact Unity Ads or us at <a href="mailto:hello.caffeinateddev@gmail.com">hello.caffeinateddev@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Data is retained only as long as needed for ad services, as outlined in <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity’s Privacy Policy</a>. We may prompt you for consent before collecting data, especially in regions requiring it (e.g., EEA).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section5">
        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some regions). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided data, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello.caffeinateddev@gmail.com">hello.caffeinateddev@gmail.com</a>, and we will take steps to delete it.</p>
